Problem:
People are losing the ability to describe how they feel and express themselves. Along with this, 
people with some mental health issues find it difficult to be in charge of their emotions.
For this reason, there needs to exist a simple and private way to keep a track of how a person
is feeling. Hence "I feel fine" or just "FINE!".

Proposed Solution:
An emotion logging app based on the emotion wheel as presented in the attached [emotionwheel.png].
Each entry should be very simple to add (maybe with a simple swipe or a tap), allow users to 
go through the emotion heirarchy as presented in the attached image resource.

It should also remind the users at set intervals to log their emotions and keep a diary of entries
with added notes and possibly images (however these should not be necessary).
